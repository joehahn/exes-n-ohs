This demo performs a simple machine-learning experiment in the datascience.com
cloud, using scikit-learn to fit an support vector machine (SVM) model
to a simple but very noisy dataset, and then keras to fit a simple neural-net model
to that same data.

### decision boundaries

All records in this dataset are simple pairs of (x,y) coordinates, and each record
in this dataset is labelled as a members of either the X, O, or B classes, with
membership determined by the following decision boundary

that depends only on each record's

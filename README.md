This demo performs a simple machine-learning experiment in the datascience.com
cloud, using scikit-learn to fit a support vector machine (SVM) model
to a simple but rather noisy dataset, and then keras to fit a simple neural-net model
to that same data.

### decision boundaries

All records in this dataset include a simple pair of (x,y) coordinates, and each record
in this dataset is then labelled as a members of either the X, O, or B classes, depending
upon where those (x,y) coordinates reside with following decision boundary:

Execute the decision_boundaries.ipynb notebook to generate a sample of (x,y) coordinates
and to plot this system's decision boundaries
